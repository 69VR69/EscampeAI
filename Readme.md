## Description
This project is a school project for the AI course at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne. The goal is to create an AI for the Escampe game.

## How to use
To use the AI you must start the server by doing : 
```bash
cd ./src/
java -cp escampeobf.jar escampe.ServeurJeu 1234 1
```
Then you can start the AI by using the ClientJeu configuration file. You can change the configuration.
If you want that the AI play against itself you can start two instances of the AI with the same configuration file.
